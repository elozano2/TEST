Introduction
===
For the assignment, I decided to go ahead and try out the elevator  
available at the Hyatt Place located on Mac Davis Lane. The assignment  
asked me to record the elevator in use, making sure to record  
how the elevator panel looked like and how the panel itslef functioned  
when interacted with by someone. I was then required to analize  
the video and figure out the positives and negatives of the elevator  
and come up with solutions that could fix these negatives. In addition  
I was required to create a sketch of the improved design with proper  
reasoning for these changes. Finally, I was required to create a program that  
shows this design in action. In this case, I decided to create my program in  
Processing.

Throughout this readme, you will see it will be split into different sections.  
Each section will be based on a letter grade, where I was required to  
meet some criterea in order to achieve that letter grade.
